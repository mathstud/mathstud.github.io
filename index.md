Welcome to Anya's Portfolio.

I'm a Master’s student in Applied Mathematics at University of Colorado, Boulder. My interests are in conducting statistical and data analysis to provide data-driven insight into solving problems in healthcare and beyond. My main projects are:
- Optimization of Natural Language Processing Models: Detecting and Analyzing Cybersecurity Events (Capstone hosted by Sandia Labs)
- Multi-Strain Modeling and the Impact of Cross-Immunity on Infection Dynamics
- Prevalence of Diabetes by Region and Income Group: A Statistical Modeling Approach

These projects and presentation slides can be found in their corresponding above tabs. Other course work and past internship work can be found in the same tabs.
