Welcome to Anya's Portfolio.

I'm a Masterâ€™s student in Applied Mathematics at University of Colorado, Boulder. My interests are in conducting statistical and data analysis to provide data-driven insight into solving problems in healthcare and beyond. My main projects are:
- Capstone: Detecting and Analyzing Cybersecurity Events (hosted by Sandia Labs) (in progress)
- Modeling of Infectious Diseases (in progress)
- Prevalence of Diabetes by Region and Income Group: A Statistical Modeling Approach.

These projects and presentation slides can be found in their corresponding above tabs.
