About Me

Hi, my name is Anya Lee and I'm from San Jose, CA. I graduated with a BS in Mathematics with an option in Statistics from Oregon State University in 2024 and I am currently a second year MS student in Applied Mathematics specializing in Statistics and Data Science expecting to graduate Spring 2026. I am interested in using statistcal and data analysis to help produce data driven decisions in the healthcare field. I have experience using Python, R, Spark, Scala, and SQL from my courses in both undergraduate and graduate studies. 

I am a big dog lover and would never miss a boba outing with my friends. If I had to describe myself in three words, they would be athletic, hardworking, and organized. In my spare time, I enjoy baking, bowling, and eating out. Other hobbies that I love are playing badminton and pickleball and going to the gym when I can.
