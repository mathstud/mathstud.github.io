Hi, my name is Anya Lee and I'm from San Jose, CA. I graduated with a BS in Mathematics with an option in Statistics from Oregon State University in 2024, and I am currently a second year MS student in Applied Mathematics specializing in Statistics and Data Science, expecting to graduate Spring 2026. I am interested in using statistcal and data analysis methods to help support data-driven decision making in the healthcare field.

I have experience working with Python, R, Spark, Scala, and SQL through both my undergraduate and graduate coursework. 

Outside of academics, I'm a big dog lover and enjoy spending time with friends over boba. I would describe myself as athletic, hardworking, and organized. In my free time, I love baking, bowling, and exploring new restaurants, as well as playing badminton, pickleball, and going to the gym.
